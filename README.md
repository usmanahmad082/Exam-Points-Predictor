# What is Soot?

Soot is a Java optimization framework. It provides four intermediate representations for analyzing and transforming Java bytecode:

* Baf: a streamlined representation of bytecode which is simple to manipulate.
* Jimple: a typed 3-address intermediate representation suitable for optimization.
* Shimple: an SSA variation of Jimple.
* Grimp: an aggregated version of Jimple suitable for decompilation and code inspection.

# How do I get started with Soot?

We have some documentation on Soot in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki) and also a large range of [tutorials](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/tutorial/index.html) on Soot."# Exam-Points-Predictor"
